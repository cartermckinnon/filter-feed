# `filter-feed`

This project produces one binary that contains:
1. A stateless, (aspirationally) transparent, filtering proxy for RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds.
2. A command-line tool for fetching and filtering said feeds.

## Usage

### As a command-line tool.
```
filter-feed fetch URL FILTER
```
Where:
- `URL` is the URL for the feed.
- `FILTER` is either:
  - A `FilterSpec`
  - A `FilterSpec`
  - A patch to a JSON file beginning with `file://`.

### As a proxy.

Start the server:
```sh
filter-feed server --address ":8080"
```

Or start the server in a container:
```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/cartermckinnon/filter-feed
```

Generate a URL:
```sh
filter-feed url URL FILTER
```

Where `URL` and `FILTER` are as defined above.

It will look something like:
```
/v1/f/ChRodHRwczovL2NhdC5mZWVkL3JzcxIYCgVyZWdleBIILipjYXRzLioaBXRpdGxl
```

Just send a `GET` for that path to a `filter-feed` server, such as the one I run at `filter-feed.me`:
```
curl https://filter-feed.me/v1/f/ChRodHRwczovL2NhdC5mZWVkL3JzcxIYCgVyZWdleBIILipjYXRzLioaBXRpdGxl
```

For example, you could add such a link to your favorite podcast player.
